\begin{question}
\puntos{3.5}In a pharmacy, the amount of paracetamol $Q$ demanded by customers depends on the price of paracetamol $p$ and the price of ibuprofen $b$, according to the function

$$Q(p,b) = \frac{6b}{(p-1)p}$$
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For which values of $p$ and $b$ this function make sense in this context?
\item If the price of paracetamol increases, will the demand for paracetamol increase or decrease?
\item If the prices of paracetamol and ibuprofen are $p=2$ and $b=1$ â‚¬, how should the prices of paracetamol and ibuprofen vary so that the quantity demanded of paracetamol increases as much as possible?
\item Assuming the same prices as in the previous question, how much will the quantity of paracetamol demanded change if the price of paracetamol increases half of ibuprofen price increase?
\end{enumerate}
