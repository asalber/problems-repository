1.  **Question**\
    To analyze the hypoxemia tolerance of mammals, in a laboratory some
    rats are exposed to extreme conditions with variable levels of
    oxygen. The rats are in a room whose oxygen level (in %) at any
    position $(x,y)$ is

    $$O(x,y)=\frac{1}{10}x^2y^2e^{x-y}$$

    For the rats to survive, they must reach positions where the oxygen
    level is above 18%.

    1.  A rat $A$ is at position $(3,2)$. If the rat stays in that
        position, will it survive?

    2.  What direction should rat $A$ take in order to increase the
        oxygen level as quickly as possible? What is the instantaneous
        rate of change of the oxygen level following that direction?

    3.  Another rat $B$ is at position $(2,2)$. If it starts to move in
        such a way that $y$ decreases the double of the increment of
        $x$, how will the oxygen level change?

    **Solution**\

2.  **Question**\
    The ozone ($O_3$) in the atmosphere is transformed into oxygen
    ($O_2$) through the following chemical reaction:

    $$2O_3 \rightarrow 3O_2$$

    It was experimentally observed that the speed at which the amount of
    oxygen varies is inversely proportional to the amount of oxygen
    present. If there is initially 10 g of oxygen in a place, and after
    one hour this amount of oxygen doubles,

    1.  What will the amount of oxygen be after 5 hours?

    2.  How long will it take to have 1 kg of oxygen?

    **Solution**\

3.  **Question**\
    Two insects start moving from the same point following perpendicular
    directions.

    1.  If the first insect moves at a speed of 3 cm/s and the second at
        a speed of 4 cm/s, at what instantaneous speed does the distance
        between them change 2 seconds after they start moving? And at 3
        seconds?

    2.  If 4 seconds after they start moving the second insect stops and
        the first continues moving with the same direction and speed, at
        what instantaneous speed does the distance between the two
        insects change at that moment?

    Remark: The distance between the two insects is the length of the
    hypotenuse of the right triangle whose sides are the distance
    traveled by them.

    **Solution**\
