2. $F(115)=0.1667 \rightarrow 16.67%$ of people working with computers have reduced mobility.<br/>
3. With computer: $\bar x=132.3333$ degrees, $s_x^2=312.8889$ degrees², $s_x=17.6887$ degrees and $cv_x=0.1337$<br/>
Without computer:  $\bar x=151.0714$ degrees, $s_x^2=245.2806$ degrees², $s_x=15.6614$ degrees and $cv_x=0.1037$<br/>
The mean of people working without computer is more representative than the mean of people working with computers since its coefficient of variation is smaller.<br/>
4. $\bar x=141.3793$.<br/>
5. With computer $g_1=0.6243$ and without computer $g_1=-0.3938$. Therefore, the distribution of people working with computers is more asymmetric.<br/>
6. Standard scores: $z(150)=0.9988$ and $z(170)=1.2086$. Therefore, an arc of rotation of 150 degrees in people working with computers is relatively smaller than an arc of rotation of 170 in people working without computers.
