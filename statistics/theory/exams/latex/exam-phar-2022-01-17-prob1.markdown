1.  **Question**\
    A diagnostic test for a disease with a prevalence of 10% has a
    positive predictive value of 40% and negative predictive value of
    95%.

    1.  Compute the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.

    2.  Compute the probability of a right diagnose.

    3.  What must be the minimum sensitivity of the test to be able to
        diagnose the disease?

    **Solution**\

2.  **Question**\
    To study the effectiveness of two antigen tests for the COVID both
    tests have been applied to a sample of 100 persons. The table below
    shows the results:

    $$\begin{array}{ccr}
      \hline
      \mbox{Test $A$} & \mbox{Test $B$} & \mbox{Num persons}\\
      + & + & 8\\
      + & - & 2\\
      - & + & 3\\
      - & - & 87\\
      \hline
      \end{array}$$

    Define the following events and compute its probabilities:

    1.  Get a $+$ in the test $A$.

    2.  Get a $+$ in the test $A$ and a $-$ in the test $B$.

    3.  Get a $+$ in some of the two tests.

    4.  Get different results in the two tests.

    5.  Get the same result in the two tests.

    6.  Get a $+$ in the test $B$ if we got a $+$ in the test $A$.

    Are the outcomes of the two tests independent?

3.  **Question**\
    It is known that the life of a battery for a peacemaker follows a
    normal distribution. It has been observed that 20% of the batteries
    last more than 15 years, while 10% last less than 12 years.

    1.  Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the battery
        life.\
        Remark: If you are not able to compute the mean and the standard
        deviation, use a mean of 14 years and a standard deviation of
        1.5 years for the following parts.

    2.  Compute the fourth decile of the battery life.

    3.  If we take a sample of 5 batteries, what is the probability that
        more than half of them last between 13 and 14 years?

    4.  If we take a sample of 100 batteries, what is the probability
        that some of them last less than 11 years?

    **Solution**\
