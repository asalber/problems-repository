1.  **Question**\
    A test to detect the COVID19 was applied to 850 persons infected by
    COVID19 with a positive outcome in 800 of them, and it was also
    applied to 9150 non-infected persons with a positive outcome in 10%
    of them.

    1.  Compute the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.

    2.  Compute the positive and the negative predictive values and
        interpret them.

    3.  Compute the probability of a correct diagnostic.

    **Solution**\
    Let $D$ the event corresponding to suffering COVID19 and $+$ and $-$
    the events corresponding to get a positive and a negative outcome
    respectively.

    1.  The sensitivity is $P(+|D) = 0.9412$ and specificity
        $P(-|\overline D) = 0.9$.

    2.  Positive predictive value $P(D|+) = 0.4665$ and negative
        predictive value $P(\overline D|-) = 0.994$. As de positive
        predictive value is less than 0.5 we can not use this test to
        confirm COVID19, but we can use it to rule it out with a strong
        confidence since the negative predictive value is pretty close
        to 1.

    3.  $P(D\cap +) + P(\overline D\cap -) = 0.9035$.

2.  **Question**\
    A newborn baby affected by Moebius syndrome blinks, on average,
    twice a minute.

    1.  Compute the probability that a newborn blinks twice in half a
        minute.

    2.  In a hospital five children have been born with Moebius
        syndrome. Compute the probability that at least 3 of them blink
        in their first minute of life.

    3.  In which distribution is more representative the mean, in the
        number of times that a newborn blinks in a minute or in the
        number of times that a newborn blinks in half a minute?

    **Solution**\

    1.  Let $X$ be the number of times that a newborn blinks in half a
        minute, then $X\sim P(1)$ and $P(X=2)=0.1839$.

    2.  Let $Y$ be the number of newborns that blink in their first
        minute of life in a sample of 5 newborns, then
        $Y\sim B(5, 0.8647)$ and $P(Y\geq 3)=0.98$.

    3.  Let $Z$ be the number of times that a newborn blinks in a
        minute, then $cv_z = 0.7071$ and $cv_x = 1$. Thus, the mean of
        $Z$ represents better since its coefficient of variation is
        smaller.

3.  **Question**\
    The prolactin level in pregnant and non-pregnant females follows a
    normal distribution with different means but with the same variance.
    When the prolactin levels exceed 15 ng/ml, females secrete milk
    through their mammary glands. It is known that 95% of pregnant
    females secrete milk but only 1% of non-pregnant females secret
    milk.

    1.  If the median of the prolactin level in pregnant females is 16
        ng/ml, what are the means and the standard deviation of the
        prolactin level in both populations?\
        Remark: If you are not able to compute the mean or the standard
        deviation for pregnant females, use $\mu=17$ ng/ml and
        $\sigma=2$ ng/ml for the next parts.

    2.  Compute the percentage of pregnant females with a prolactin
        level between 15.5 and 17 ng/ml.

    3.  Compute the prolactin level such that 20% of pregnant females
        are above that level.

    **Solution**\
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be the prolactin levels in pregnant and non-pregnan
    females respectively.

    1.  $\mu_x=16$ ng/ml, $\mu_y=13.5857$ ng/ml and $\sigma=0.608$
        ng/ml.

    2.  $P(15.5<X<17) = 0.7446$, so 74.4583% of pregnant females.

    3.  $P_{80} = 16.5117$ ng/ml.

4.  **Question**\
    An organism has the same chance of being infected by a virus and a
    bacteria. At the same time, the probability of being infected by a
    virus doubles when the organism has been previously infected by a
    bacteria. On the other hand, the probability of being infected by no
    pathogen (neither virus nor bacteria) is $0.52$.

    1.  What is the probability of being infected by a virus and a
        bacteria at the same time?

    2.  What is the probability of being infected by a bacteria if it
        has been infected by a virus?

    3.  What is the probability of being infected only by a virus?

    4.  Are the events of being infected by a virus an a bacteria
        independent?

    **Solution**\
    Let $V$ and $B$ the events corresponding to be infected by a virus
    and a bacteria respectively.

    1.  $P(V\cap B) = 0.32$.

    2.  $P(B|V) = 0.8$.

    3.  $P(V\cap \overline B) = 0.08$.

    4.  The events are dependents since $P(V) = 0.4 \neq 0.8 = P(V|B)$.
