\begin{enumerate}

  \textbf{Question}\\
  The chart below shows the distribution of the number of subjects
  passed in a sample of first year students of a degree.

  \includegraphics{media/supplements1/exercise1/des-18-gen-cumulative-distribution-subjects.svg}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Draw the box and whiskers plot and interpret it.
  \item
    Compute the central tendency statistics and interpret them.
  \item
    How is the asymmetry of the distribution? And the kurtosis? Can we
    assume that the sample comes from a normal population?
  \item
    If the mean of subjects passed in the second year was 5.5 and the
    variance was 2, is the mean of the subjects passed in the first year
    more or less representative than the one of the second year?
  \item
    Which student is better, a first year student that pass 7 subjects
    or a second year student that pass 6 subjects?
  \end{enumerate}

  Use the following sums for the computations: \(\sum x_i=478\)
  subjects, \(\sum x_i^2=3036\) subjects\(^2\),
  \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=29.5\) subjects\(^3\) and
  \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=1226.27\) subjects\(^4\).

  \textbf{Solution}\\

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Quartiles: \(Q_1=5\) subjects, \(Q_2=6\) subjects, \(Q_3=7\)
    subjects.\\
    \(IQR = 2\) subjects.\\
    Fences: \(f_1=2\) subjects and \(f_2=10\) subjects.

    \includegraphics{media/supplements1/exercise1/des-18-gen-boxplot-subjects.svg}
  \item
    \(\bar x=5.975\) subjects, \(Me=6\) subjects and \(Mo=6\) subjects.
  \item
    \(s^2=2.2494\) (subjects)\(^2\), \(s=1.4998\) subjects and
    \(cv=0.251\).\\
    \(g_1=0.1093\), so that the distribution is slightly skewed to the
    right.\\
    \(g_2=0.0295\), so that the distribution flatter than a Gauss
    bell.\\
    We can assume that the sample comes from a normal population as
    both, the coefficient of skewness, and the coefficient of curtosis
    are between -2 and 2.
  \item
    Let \(Y\) the number of subjects passed the second year. Then,
    \(cv_x=0.251\) and \(cv_y=0.2571\). As the coefficient of variation
    of the first year is a little bit smaller than the one of the second
    year, the mean of the first year is a little bit more
    representative.
  \item
    Standard score for the first year: \(z(7)=0.6834\)\\
    Standard score for the second year: \(z(6)=0.3536\)\\
    As the standard score of \(7\) the first year is greater than the
    standard score of \(6\) the second year, the firs year student is
    better.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Question}\\
  The table below shows the number of days of rehabilitation for a knee
  injury, and the knee flexion angle in degrees after those days.

  \begin{array}{lrrrrrrrrr}
     \hline
  \mbox{Days} & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 35 & 40 & 45 & 50 \\ 
    \mbox{Angle} & 45 & 58 & 65 & 75 & 82 & 88 & 91 & 93 & 94 \\ 
     \hline
  \end{array}\]

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Compute the covariance of the number of days of rehabilitation and
    the knee flexion angle, and interpret it.
  \item
    According to the regression line, how many degrees increases or
    decreases the knee flexion angle per day of rehabilitation?
  \item
    According to the logarithmic model, what is the expected number of
    degrees of the knee flexion angle after 32 days? Is this prediction
    more or less reliable than the prediction of the linear model?
  \item
    According to the exponential model, how many days of rehabilitation
    are required to get a knee flexion angle of 120 degrees. Is this
    prediction reliable?
  \end{enumerate}

  Use the following sums for the computations (\(X\)=Days of
  rehabilitation and \(Y\)=knee flexion angle):\\
  \(\sum x_i=270\) days, \(\sum \log(x_i)=29.5894\)
  \(\log(\mbox{days})\), \(\sum y_j=691\) degrees,
  \(\sum \log(y_j)=38.8298\) \(\log(\mbox{degrees})\),\\
  \(\sum x_i^2=9600\) days\(^2\), \(\sum \log(x_i)^2=99.5821\)
  \(\log(\mbox{days})^2\), \(\sum y_j^2=55473\) degrees\(^2\),
  \(\sum \log(y_j)^2=168.0436\) \(\log(\mbox{degrees})^2\),\\
  \(\sum x_iy_j=22560\) days\(\cdot\)degrees,
  \(\sum x_i\log(y_j)=1190.8727\) days\(\cdot\log(\mbox{degrees})\),
  \(\sum \log(x_i)y_j=2346.0281\) \(\log(\mbox{days})\)degrees,
  \(\sum \log(x_i)\log(y_j)=128.738\)
  \(\log(\mbox{days})\log(\mbox{degrees})\).

  \textbf{Solution}\\

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \(\overline{x}=30\) days, \(s_x^2=166.6667\) days\(^2\).\\
    \(\bar y=76.7778\) degrees, \(s_y^2=268.8395\) degrees\(^2\).\\
    \(s_{xy}=203.3333\) days\(\cdot\)degrees.\\
    As the covariance is positive, there is a direct linear relation
    between the number of days of rehabilitation and the knee flexion
    angle.
  \item
    \(b_{yx}=1.22\), therefore the knee flexion angle will increase
    \(1.22\) degrees per day of rehabilitation.
  \item
    \(\overline{\log(x)}=3.2877\) log(days), \(s_{\log(x)}^2=0.2557\)
    log(days)\(^2\).\\
    \(s_{\log(x)y}=8.247\) log(days)degrees.\\
    Logarithmic regression model: \(y=-29.2741+32.2571\log(x)\).\\
    Prediction: \(y(32)=82.5205\) degrees.\\
    The logarithmic coefficient of determination is \(0.9895\) and the
    linear coefficient of determination is \(0.9227\). Thus, the
    prediction with the logarithmic model is more reliable as the
    coefficient of determination of the logarithmic model is greater.
  \item
    Exponential regression model: \(y=e^{0.9324+0.0307y}\).\\
    Prediction: \(y(120)=100.8475\) days.\\
    This prediction is not reliable as 120 degrees falls far away of the
    range of values observed in the sample for the knee flexion angle.
