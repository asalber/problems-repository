1.  **Question**\
    A test to detect prostate cancer produces 1% of false positives and
    0.2% false negatives. It is known that 1 in 400 males suffer this
    type of cancer.

    1.  Compute the sensitivity and the specificity of the test.

    2.  If a male got a positive outcome in the test, what is the chance
        of developing cancer?

    3.  Compute and interpret the negative predictive value.

    4.  Is this test better to predict or to rule out the cancer?

    5.  To study wether there is an association between the practice of
        sports and this type of cancer, a sample of 1000 males was
        drawn, of which 700 practiced sports, and it was observed that
        there were 2 males with cancer in the group of males who
        practiced sports, and there were 3 males with cancer in the
        group of males who did not practice sports. Compute the relative
        risk and the odds ratio and interpret them.

    **Solution**\
    Let $D$ the event corresponding to suffering COVID19 and $+$ and $-$
    the events corresponding to get a positive and a negative outcome
    respectively.

    1.  The sensitivity is $P(+|D) = 0.58$ and specificity
        $P(-|\overline D) = 0.01$.

    2.  Positive predictive value $P(D|+) = 0.0205$ and negative
        predictive value $P(\overline D|-) = 0.4$. As de positive
        predictive value is less than 0.5 we can not use this test to
        confirm COVID19, but we can use it to rule it out with a strong
        confidence since the negative predictive value is pretty close
        to 1.

    3.  $P(D\cap +) + P(\overline D\cap -) = 0.0297$.

2.  **Question**\
    The probability that a child of a mother with the color-blind gene
    and a father without the color-blind gene is a color-blind male is
    $0.25$. It is also known that in a population there is one
    color-blind male for every 5000 males.

    1.  If this couple has 5 children, what is the probability that at
        most 2 of them are color-blind males?

    2.  If this couple has 5 children, and the gender of the children is
        equiprobable, what is the probability that 3 or more are
        females?

    3.  In a random samble of 10000 males of this population, what is
        the probability that more than 3 are color-blind males?

    **Solution**\

3.  **Question**\
    The primate cranial capacity follows a normal distribution with mean
    1200 cm$^3$ and standard deviation 140 cm$^3$.

    1.  Compute the probability that the cranial capacity of a primate
        is greater than 1400 cm$^3$.

    2.  Compute the probability that the cranial capacity of a primate
        is exactly than 1400 cm$^3$.

    3.  Above what cranial capacity will 20% of primates be?

    4.  Compute the interquartile range of the cranial capacity of
        primates and interpret it.

    **Solution**\
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be the prolactin levels in pregnant and non-pregnan
    females respectively.
