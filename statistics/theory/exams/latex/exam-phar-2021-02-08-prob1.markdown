1.  **Question**\
    Two treatments are being tested against Covid-19. Treatment $A$ has
    an effectiveness of 90 % while treatment $B$ has an effectiveness of
    70 %. It has also been found that in 5% of the patients affected by
    Covid-19 neither of the two treatments is effective.

    1.  Compute the probability that for a patient with Covid-19 only
        treatment $A$ is effective.

    2.  What is the probability that treatment $B$ is effective if $A$
        was not effective for a Covid-19 patient?

    3.  Are independent the two treatments?

    4.  Compute the probability that in a sample of 6 Covid-19 patients
        the treatment $A$ is effective in at least 4 of them.

    5.  Compute the probability that in a sample of 100 Covid-19
        patients there are less than 3 where none of the treatments are
        effective.

    6.  Compute the probability that in a sample of 5 Covid-19 patients
        some of the treatments is effective in at least 3 of them.

2.  **Question**\
    The Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone is used to detect the
    pregancy during the first weeks of the gestation. A test diagnose
    the pregnancy when the level of hCG is above 12 mUI/ml. Knowing that
    the concentration of hCG in non-pregnant females follows a normal
    probability distribution with mean 5 mUI/ml and standard deviation 2
    mUI/ml, while in pregnant females follows a normal probability
    distribution with mean 25 mUI/ml and standard deviation 5 mUI/ml:

    1.  Compute the percentage of pregnant females with a level of hCG
        between 15 and 20 mUI/ml.

    2.  Above what level of hCG are the 1% of non-pregnant females?

    3.  Compute the sensitiviy and the specificity of the test.

    4.  If there are 0.5% of pregnant females in a population, what is
        the percentage of false positives for the test? And the
        percentage of false negatives?
