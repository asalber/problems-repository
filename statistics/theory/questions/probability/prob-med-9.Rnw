\begin{question}
\puntos{2}An organism has the same chance of being infected by a virus and a bacteria. At the same time, the probability of being infected by a virus doubles when the organism has been previously infected by a bacteria. On the other hand, the probability of being infected by no pathogen (neither virus nor bacteria) is $0.52$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of being infected by a virus and a bacteria at the same time?
\item What is the probability of being infected by a bacteria if it has been infected by a virus?
\item What is the probability of being infected only by a virus?
\item Are the events of being infected by a virus an a bacteria independent?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
