Question
========
A 40% of a population of athletes have a very athletic mother and a 30% a very athletic father.
If 50% of athletes in this population have some very athletic progenitor:

a. Compute the probability that a radom athlete of this population have a very athletic mother if he or she has a very athletic father.

a. Compute the probability that a radom athlete of this population have a very athletic father if he or she has a non very athletic mother.

a. Â¿Are the events corresponding to having a very athletic father and having a very athletic mother independents? Justify the answer.

Solution
========
Let $M$ the event of having a very athletic mother and $F$ the event of having a very athletic father.

a. $P(M|F) = `r round(pMsiF,4)`$

a. $P(F|\overline M) = `r round(pFsinoM,4)`$

a. No, the events are dependent since $P(M)=`r pM`\neq `r round(pMsiF,4)`=P(M|F)$.
