\begin{question}
\puntos{3}There are three techniques for a surgical operation on the meniscus: technique $A$ is used in 30\% of cases, $B$ in 25\% and $C$ in 45\%. The probability of suffering osteoarthritis after a surgical operation on the meniscus is 8\% with technique $A$, 15\% with technique $B$ and  5\% with technique $C$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of not suffering osteoarthritis after a surgical operation on the meniscus.
\item Knowing that a patient suffers from osteoarthritis after the operation, what is the most likely technique used in the operation?
\item Keeping the rest of the probabilities given in the statement the same, what must the probabilities of techniques $A$ and $B$ be so that the probability of having been operated with the technique $A$ is the same as the probability having been operated with the technique $B$, if you have osteoarthritis?
\end{enumerate}
