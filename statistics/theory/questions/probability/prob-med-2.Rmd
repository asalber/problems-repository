Question
========
A study about hypertension has found that `r pH*100`% of people suffer hypertension, that `r pHsiS*100`% of smokers suffer hypertension and that `r pnoSsinoH*100`% of people without hypertension are non smokers.


a. Compute the probability that a person is a smoker.

a. Compute the probability that a person is a smoker or suffers hypertension.

a. Compute the probability that a non smoker person does not suffer hypertension.

a. Does suffering hypertension depend on smoking?

Solution
========

a. $P(S)=`r round(pS,4)`$.

a. $P(H\cup S)=`r round(pHoS,4)`$.

a. $P(\overline H|\overline S)=`r round(pnoHsinoS,4)`$.

a. Yes, because $P(S)=`r round(pS,4)`\neq `r round(pSsiH,4)`=P(S|H)$.
