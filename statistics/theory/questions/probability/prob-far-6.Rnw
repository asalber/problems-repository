\begin{question}
\puntos{2.5}In a study about the efectiveness of two flu drugs $A$ and $B$ it has been observed in a clinical trial that in 12\% of cases only drug $A$ is effective, in 24\% of cases only drug $B$ is effective and in 80\% of cases where drug $A$ was effective, also was effective the drug $B$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that both drugs are efective at the same time?
\item What is the probability that only one of the drugs is effective?
\item What is the probability that none of the drugs are effective?
\item Are the effectiveness of the two drugs independent?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
According to the problem statement, $P(A\cap \overline B) = \Sexpr{pANoB}$, $P(\overline A\cap B)=\Sexpr{pNoAB}$ and $P(B|A)=\Sexpr{pBSiA}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(A\cap B)=\Sexpr{pAB}$.
\item $P(A\cap \overline B) + P(\overline A\cap B) =\Sexpr{pANoB + pNoAB}$.
\item $P(\overline A \cap \overline B) = \Sexpr{pNoANoB}$.
\item The events are dependent because $P(B)=\Sexpr{pB} \neq P(B|A)=\Sexpr{pBSiA}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
