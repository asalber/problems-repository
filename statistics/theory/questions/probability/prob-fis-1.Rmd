## QUESTION/ANSWER GENERATION

pAB <- pA + pB - pAoB

## Question

The probability that an injury $A$ is repeated is $`r fractions(pA)`$, the probability that another injury $B$ is repeated is $`r fractions(pB)`$, and the probability that none of them are repeated is $`r fractions(pNoANoB)`$.
Compute the probability of the following events:

1. At least one injury is repeated.
2. Only injury $B$ is repeated.
3. Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has been repeated.
4. Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has not been repeated. 

## Solution

1. $P(A\cup B)=`r fractions(pAoB)`$.
2. $P(B\cap\overline{A})=`r fractions(pNoAB)`$.
3. $P(B/A)=`r fractions(pBSiA)`$.
4. $P(B/\overline{A})=`r fractions(pBSiNoA)`$.
