Question
========
The probability that an injury $A$ is repeated is $`r fractions(pA)`$, the probability that another injury $B$ is repeated is $`r fractions(pB)`$, and the probability that none of them are repeated is $`r fractions(pNoANoB)`$.
Compute the probability of the following events:

a. At least one injury is repeated.

a. Only injury $B$ is repeated.

a. Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has been repeated.

a. Injury $B$ is repeated if injury $A$ has not been repeated. 

Solution
========

a. $P(A\cup B)=`r fractions(pAoB)`$.

a. $P(B\cap\overline{A})=`r fractions(pNoAB)`$.

a. $P(B/A)=`r fractions(pBSiA)`$.

a. $P(B/\overline{A})=`r fractions(pBSiNoA)`$.
