\begin{question}
\puntos{5}In a course there are 150 students, of which 50 are working students and the other 100 non-working students. The table below shows the frequency distribution of the grade in an exam of these two groups:

$$
<<echo=FALSE, results=tex>>=
print(xtable(data, align=c("c", "c", "r", "r"), auto=T), tabular.environment="array", include.rownames = F, floating=F, hline.after = c(0,nrow(data)), sanitize.text.function = function(x) { x })
@
$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the percentage of students that passed the exam (a grade 5 or above) in both groups, working and non-working students.
\item In which group is there a higher relative dispersion of the grade with respect to the mean? 
\item Which grade distribution is more asymmetric, the distribution of working students, or the non-working students one?
\item To apply for a scholarship to go abroad, the grade must be transformed applying the linear transformation Y = 0.5 + X * 1.45. Compute the mean of Y for the two groups. How changes the asymmetry of the two groups?
\item Which grade is relatively higher, 6 in the working students group, or 7 in the non-working students group?
\end{enumerate}

Use the following sums for the computations:\\
Non-working students: $\sum x_in_i=\Sexpr{sum(x)}$, $\sum x_i^2n_i=\Sexpr{sum(x^2)}$, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3n_i=\Sexpr{round(sum((x-mx)^3),2)}$ y $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4n_i=\Sexpr{round(sum((x-mx)^4),2)}$.\\
Working students: $\sum y_in_i=\Sexpr{sum(y)}$, $\sum y_i^2n_i=\Sexpr{sum(y^2)}$, $\sum (y_i-\bar y)^3n_i=\Sexpr{round(sum((y-my)^3),2)}$ y $\sum (y_i-\bar y)^4n_i=\Sexpr{round(sum((y-my)^4),2)}$.
\end{question}


%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 66.5\% of non-working stsudents passed and 59\% of working students passed.
\item Non-working students: $\bar x=\Sexpr{round(mx,4)}$, $s^2=\Sexpr{round(s2x,4)}$, $s=\Sexpr{round(sx,4)}$ and $cv=\Sexpr{round(cvx,4)}$.\\
Working students: $\bar y=\Sexpr{round(my,4)}$, $s^2=\Sexpr{round(s2y,4)}$, $s=\Sexpr{round(sy,4)}$ and $cv=\Sexpr{round(cvy,4)}$.\\
The sample of non-working students has a slightly higher relative dispersion with respect to the mean as the coefficient of variation is greater.
\item Non-working students: $g_1=\Sexpr{round(g1x,4)}$.\\
Working students: $g_1=\Sexpr{round(g1y,4)}$.\\
Thus, the sample of non-working students is more assymetric as the coefficient os skewness is further from 0.
\item Non-working students: $\bar y=\Sexpr{round(myx, 4)}$.\\
Working students: $\bar x=\Sexpr{round(myy, 4)}$.\\
The coefficient of skewness does not change as the slope of the linear transformation is positive.\\
\item Non-working students: $z(7)=\Sexpr{round(zx, 4)}$.\\
Working students: $z(6)=\Sexpr{round(zy, 4)}$.\\
Thus, a 7 in the sample of non-working students is relatively higher than than a 6 in the sample of working students, as its standard score is greater.
\end{enumerate}
