Question
========
\hspace{-2.05cm}(2 pts.)\hspace{0.6cm} In a population where the prevalence of a disease is 10% we apply a diagnostic test with a sensitivity 85%.
What must be the minimum specificity of the test to diagnose the disease when the outcome of the test is positive?
Solution
========
The specificity must be at least $`r round(spe,4)`$.
