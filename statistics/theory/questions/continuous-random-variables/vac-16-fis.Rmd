Question
========
The thoracic perimeter of a male population of ages between 25 and 40 follows a normal distribution of mean 102 cm. It is also known that 20%: of the population have a perimeter above 111 cm. 

a. Compute the standard deviation of the thoracic perimeter.  
Remark: If you do not know how to compute it, use a standard deviation of 9.5 cm for the next parts.
a. Compute the interquartile range of the thoracic perimeter distribution.
a. What is the probability that in a sample of 100 males from this population, there are at most 3 with a thoracic perimeter less than 82 cm?
