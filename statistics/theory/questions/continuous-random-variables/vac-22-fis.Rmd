Question
========
In a population of 20000 women, it is known that back width follows a normal distribution with mean $29$ cm and standard deviation $2.4$ cm.(3)

a. Compute the number of women with a back width greater than $32$ cm.
a. Compute the interquartile range of women's back width.
a. If we pick 12 random women from that population, what is the probability that there are at least 2 with a back width less than 28.5 cm?
