Question
========
In women, the shoulder circumference follows a normal distribution with mean 98 cm and standard deviation 5 cm.

a. Compute the percentage of women in the population with a shoulder circumference between 95 and 105 cm.
a. Above what value are the 5%: of women with a highest shoulder circumference?
a. Compute the probability that in a sample of 50 women there is at least 2 with a shoulder circumference less than 90 cm.

Solution
========
Let $X$ be the shoulder circumference, then $X\sim N(98, 5)$.

a. $P(95\leq X\leq 105) = 0.645$, that is $6.45%:$.
a. $P_{95} = 106.22$ cm.
a. Let $Y$ be the number of women with a shoulder circumference less than 90 cm in a sample of 50 women. Then, $Y\sim B(50, 0.0548) \approx P(2.74)$, and $P(Y\geq 2) = 0.7585$.
