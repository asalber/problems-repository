Question
========
The time required to cure a basketball injury with a rehabilitation technique follows a normal distribution with quartiles $Q_1 = 22$ days and $Q_2 = 25$ days.

a. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the curation time.

a. If a player has just been injured and has to play a match in 30 days, what is the probability that he will miss it?

a. Calculate the interquartile range of the curation time distribution.

Solution
========

a. Let $X$ be the time required to cure the injury, then $X\sim N(`r round(mean, 4)`, `r round(sd, 4)`)$.

a. $P(X > 30) = `r round(p, 4)`$.

a. $IQR = `r round(iqr, 4)`$ days.
