Question
========
In a course with 200 students the score of a test to measure the intelligence quotient follows a normal distribution. After applying the test to the students 10 of them got a score above 130 and 30 of them a score below 60.

a. Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the score.

a. How many students will have a score between 90 and 95?

a. Compute the limits of the interval centered at the mean that accumulates 95% of the scores.

Solution
========

a. Let $X$ be the score of the test then $X\sim N(`r round(mean, 4)`, `r round(sd, 4)`)$

a. $P(90\leq X \leq 95) = `r round(p, 4)`$, that is, around $`r round(p * 200, 4)`$ students.

a. Interval with 95% of probability $(`r round(llim, 4)`, `r round(ulim, 4)`)$.
