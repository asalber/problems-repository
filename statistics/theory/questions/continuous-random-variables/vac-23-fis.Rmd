Question
========
(2.5 points) In a population of 20000 women, it is known that back width follows a normal distribution with mean 29 cm and standard deviation 2.4 cm.

a. Compute the number of women with a back width greater than 32 cm.

a. Compute the interquartile range of women's back width and interpret it.

a. Compute the probability that a woman with a back width above the third quartile, has a back width above 32.

Solution
========

Let $X$ be the back width, then $X\sim N(`r mx`, `r sx`)$.

a. $P(X>32) = `r round(p1, 4)`$ and approximately $`r round(20000*p1)`$ persons have a back width greater than 32 cm. 

a. $Q_1 = `r round(q1, 4)`$ cm, $Q_3 = `r round(q3, 4)`$ cm, and $IQR = `r round(q3-q1, 4)`$ cm.

a. $P(X>32| X>`r round(q3, 4)`) = `r round(p2, 4)`$.
