## Question

The table below shows the number of injuries of several teams during a league and the average varm-up time of its players. 

```{r data-table, echo=F}
print(xtable(table, auto=T), include.colnames = F, floating=F, hline.after = c(0,nrow(table)), booktabs = T)
```

1. Draw the scatter plot.
2. Which regression model is more suitable to predict the number of injuries as a function of the warm-up time, the logarithmic or the exponential? 
Use that regression model to predict the expected number of injuries for a team whose players warm-up 20 minutes a day.
3. Which regression model is more suitable to predict the warm-up time as a function of the number of injuries, the logarithmic or the exponential? 
Use that regression model to predict the warm-up time required to have no more than 10 injuries in a league.
4. Are these predictions reliable? Which one is more reliable?

Use the following sums for the computations ($X$ warm-up time and $Y$ number of injuries):  
$\sum x_i=`r sum(x)`$, $\sum \log(x_i)=`r round(sum(log(x)),4)`$, $\sum y_j=`r sum(y)`$, $\sum \log(y_j)=`r round(sum(log(y)),4)`$,    
$\sum x_i^2=`r sum(x^2)`$, $\sum \log(x_i)^2=`r round(sum(log(x)^2),4)`$, $\sum y_j^2=`r sum(y^2)`$, $\sum \log(y_j)^2=`r round(sum(log(y)^2),4)`$,  
$\sum x_iy_j=`r sum(x*y)`$, $\sum x_i\log(y_j)=`r round(sum(x*log(y)),4)`$, $\sum \log(x_i)y_j=`r round(sum(log(x)*y),4)`$, $\sum \log(x_i)\log(y_j)=`r round(sum(log(x)*log(y)),4)`$.


## Solution

1. 
```{r scatterplot-injuries-warm-up, fig=T, echo=F, height=3, width=4, dev=svg, fig.path="images"}
plot(x, y, main="Scatter plot of warm-up time and injuries", xlab = "Warm-up time", ylab="Injuries")
```

2. $\bar x=`r round(mx,4)`$ min, $s_x^2=`r round(s2x,4)`$ min$^2$.  
$\bar \log(x)=`r round(mlogx,4)`$ log(min), $s_{\log(x)}^2=`r round(s2logx,4)`$ log(min)$^2$.  
$\bar y=`r round(my,4)`$ injuries, $s_y^2=`r round(s2y,4)`$ injuries$^2$.  
$\bar \log(y)=`r round(mlogy,4)`$ log(injuries), $s_{\log(y)}^2=`r round(s2logy,4)`$ log(injuries)$^2$.  
$s_{x\log(y)}=`r round(sxlogy,4)`$, $s_{\log(x)y}=`r round(slogxy,4)`$  
Exponential determination coefficient: $r^2=`r round(r2xlogy,4)`$  
Logarithmic determination coefficient: $r^2=`r round(r2logxy,4)`$  
So the exponential regression model es better to predict the number of injuries as a function of the warm-up time.  
Exponential regression model: $y=e^{`r round(regexp$coefficients[1],4)`+`r round(regexp$coefficients[2],4)`x}$.  
Prediction: $y(20)=`r round(exp(regexp$coefficients[1] + regexp$coefficients[2]*20),4)`$ injuries.
3. The logarithmic model is better to predict the warm-up time as a function of the number or injuries.  
Logarithmic regression model: $x=`r round(reglog$coefficients[1],4)`+`r round(reglog$coefficients[2],4)`\log(y)$.  
Prediction: $x(10)=`r reglog$coefficients[1]+reglog$coefficients[2]*log(10)`$ min.
4. Both predictions are very reliable since de deternation coefficient is very high but the last one is a little less reliable as it is for a value further from the data range.
