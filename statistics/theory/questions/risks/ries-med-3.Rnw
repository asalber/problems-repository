\begin{question}
\puntos{2}	
An epidemiological study tries to determine the effectiveness of face masks to prevent the COVID19. In a sample 4000 persons without the virus and 1000 persons with it were selected. I was observed that in the group of infected people 120 had used face masks in the two previous weeks, while in the non-infected group, 1250 had used face masks in the two previous weeks. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the relative risk of been infected with face masks.
\item Compute the odds ratio of been infected with face masks. 
\item Which association measure is more reliable? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
Let $D$ be the event of being infected.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $RR(D)=\Sexpr{round(rr, 4)}$. Thus, the risk of being infected with face mask is almost one third of the likelihood of been infected without face mask.
\item $OR(D)=\Sexpr{round(or, 4)}$. Thus, the odds of being infected with face mask is less than one third of the likelihood of been infected without face mask.
\item As we can not compute the prevalence of $D$, the odds ratio is more reliable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
