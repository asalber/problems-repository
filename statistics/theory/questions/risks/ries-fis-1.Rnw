\begin{question}
\puntos{2}A study tries to determine the effectiveness of an occupational risk prevention program in jobs that require to be sit a lot of hours.
A sample of 500 individuals between 40 and 50 years that spent more than 5 hours sitting was drawn. Half of the individuals followed the prevention program (treatment group) and the other half not (control group). After 5 years it was observed that 12 individuals suffered spinal injuries in the group following the prevention program while 32 individuals suffered spinal injuries in the other group. In the following 5 years it was observed that 21 individuals suffered spinal injuries in the group following the prevention program while 48 individuals suffered spinal injuries in the other group. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the cumulative incidence of spinal injuries in the total sample after 5 years and after 10 years.
\item Compute the absolute risk of suffering spinal injuries in 10 years in the treatment and control groups.
\item Compute the relative risk of suffering spinal injuries in 10 years in the treatment group compared to the control group. Interpret it.
\item Compute the odds ratio of suffering spinal injuries in 10 years in the treatment group compared to the control group. Interpret it.
\item Which statistics, the relative risk or the odds ratio, is more suitable in this study? Justify the answer.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
Let $D$ be the event of suffering spinal injuries.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cumulative incidence after 5 years: $R(D)=\Sexpr{round(i5, 4)}$.\\
Cumulative incidence after 10 years: $R(D)=\Sexpr{round(i10, 4)}$.
\item Risk in the treatment group: $R_T(D)=\Sexpr{round(rt,4)}$.\\
Risk in the control group: $R_C(D)=\Sexpr{round(rc,4)}$.
\item $RR(D)=\Sexpr{round(rr, 4)}$. Thus, the risk of suffering spinal injuries is less than half following the prevention program.
\item $OR(D)=\Sexpr{round(or, 4)}$. Thus, the odd of suffering spinal injuries is less than one third following the prevention program.
\item Since the study is prospective and we can estimate the prevalence of $D$, both statistics are suitable, but relative risk is easier to interpret.
\end{enumerate}
