\begin{question}
\puntos{3}To study the association between the osteoporosis and the gender a random sample of people between 65 and 70 years old was taken.
The following table summarize the results

$$
\begin{array}{lcc}
\hline
& \mbox{Osteoporosis} & \mbox{Not osteoporosis}\\
\mbox{Women} & 480 & 2320\\
\mbox{Men} & 255 & 1505\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the prevalence of the osteoporosis in the population.
\item Compute the relative risk of osteoporosis in females with respect to males and interpret it.
\item Compute the odds ratio of osteoporosis in females with respect to males and interpret it.
\item Which of the two measures is most suitable to study the association between the osteoporosis and the gender?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
Let $D$ be the event of suffering osteoporosis.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prevalence: $P(D)=\Sexpr{round(pre,4)}$.
\item $RR(D)=\Sexpr{round(rr, 4)}$. Thus, the risk of suffering osteoporosis in women is higher than in men but not to much. There is no strong association between the osteoporosis and the gender.
\item $OR(D)=\Sexpr{round(or, 4)}$. Thus, the odds of suffering osteoporosis in women is higher than in men but not to much. 
\item Since we can compute the prevalence of $D$, both statistics are suitable, but relative risk is easier to interpret.
\end{enumerate}
