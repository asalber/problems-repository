Question
========
During the COVID19 quarantine a telephone exchange with 4 telephone operators received an average of 12 calls per day. Assuming that the calls are equally distributed among the operators,
a. Compute the probability that an operator received more than 3 calls a day. 
a. Compute the probability that all the the operators received some call a day. 

Solution
========
a. Let $X$ be the number of calls that arrive to one operator, then $X\sim P(`r lambda`)$, and $P(X>3)=`r round(sol1, 4)`$.
a. Let $Y$ be the number of operators that receive some call, then $Y\sim B(4, `r round(sol2, 4)`)$, and $P(Y=4)=`r round(sol3, 4)`$.
