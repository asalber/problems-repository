Question
========
A basketball player scores 12 points per game on average.


a. What is the probability that the player scores more than 4 points in a quarter?

a. If the player plays 10 games in a league, what is the probability of scoring less than 6 points in some game?

Solution
========

a. Let $X$ be the points scored in a quarter by the player. Then $X\sim P(3)$, and $P(X>4)=`r round(p1, 4)`$.

a. Let $Y$ be the number of points scored in a game by the player. Then $Y\sim P(12)$ and $P(Y<6)=`r round(p2,4)`$.  
Let $Z$ be the number of games with less than 6 points scored by the player. Then $Z\sim B(10, `r round(p2,4)`)$, and $P(Z>0)=`r round(p3,4)`$.
