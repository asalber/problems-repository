Question
========
The average number of injuries in an international tennis tournament is `r lambda`. 

a. Compute the probability that in an international tennis tournament there are more than `r x1` injuries.
a. If a tennis circuit has `r n` international tournaments, what is the probability that there are no injuries in some of them?

Solution
========
a. Let $X$ be the number of injuries in a tournament, then $X\sim P(`r lambda`)$ and $P(X>2)=`r round(sol1,4)`$.
a. Let $Y$ be the number of tournaments in the tennis circuit with no injuries, then $Y\sim B(`r n`,`r round(p,4)`)$ and $P(Y>0)=`r round(sol2,4)`$.
