Question
========
In a stretch of a road there is an average of 2 accidents per day.

a. Compute the probability of having more than 2 accidents a random day.

a. Compute the probability of having more than 2 accidents a random day, knowing that there is at least one accident that day.

a. Compute the probability of having 14 accidents a random week.

Solution
========

a. Let $X$ be the number of accidents in a day.
$X\sim P(`r lambda`)$ and $P(X>2)=`r round(sol1,4)`$.

a. $P(X>2|X\geq 1)=`r round(sol2,4)`$.

a. Let $Y$ be the number of accidents in a week.
$X\sim P(`r lambda*7`)$ and $P(X=14)=`r round(sol3,4)`$.
