\begin{question}
\puntos{3.5}The risks of getting the flu in two cities $A$ and $B$ with the same population size are 14\% and 8\% respectively.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the probability of having more than 2 persons getting the flu in a random sample of 10 persons of the city $A$. 
    \item Compute the probability of having more than 2 and less than 5 persons getting the flu in a random sample of 50 persons of the city $B$. 
    \item Compute the probability of having 2 persons getting the flu in a random sample of 8 persons of the two cities.
    \item Compute the probability of having some person getting the flu in a random sample of 5 persons that have been living in both cities.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{question}


%% SOLUTIONS
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $X$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 10 persons from $A$, then $X\sim B(10, 0.14)$ and $P(X>2)=\Sexpr{round(pbinom(2, 10, 0.14, lower.tail=F), 4)}$.
\item Let $Y$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 50 persons from $B$, then $Y\sim B(50, 0.08)\approx P(4)$ and $P(2 < Y < 5) = \Sexpr{round(ppois(4, 4) - ppois(2, 4), 4)}$.
\item Let $Z$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 8 persons from $A$ and $B$, then $Z\sim B(8, 0.11)$ and $P(Z = 2) = \Sexpr{round(dbinom(2, 8, 0.11), 4)}$.
\item Let $U$ be the number of persons with flu in a sample of 5 persons living in both cities, then $U\sim B(5, 0.2088)$ and $P(U>0)=\Sexpr{round(pbinom(0, 5, 0.2088, lower.tail=F), 4)}$.
