Question
========
A pharmaceutical company is trying three different analgesics to determine if there is a relation among the time required for them to take effect.
The three analgesics were administered to a sample of 20 patients and the time it took for them to take effect was recorded.
The following sums summarize the results, where $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are the times for the three analgesics.

$\sum x_i=668$ min, $\sum y_i=855$ min, $\sum z_i=1466$ min,  
$\sum x_i^2=25056$ min$^2$, $\sum y_i^2=42161$ min$^2$, $\sum z_i^2=123904$ min$^2$,  
$\sum x_iy_j=31522$ min$^2$, $\sum y_jz_j=54895$ min$^2$.


a. Is there a linear relation between the times $X$ and $Y$? And between $Y$ and $Z$? How are these linear relationships?

a. According to the regression line, how much will the time $X$ increase for every minute that time $Y$ increases?

a. If we want to predict the time $Y$ using a linear regression model, Â¿which of the two times $X$ or $Z$ is the most suitable?    Why?

a. Using the chosen linear regression model in the previous question, predict the value of $Y$ for a value of $X$ or $Z$ of 40 minutes.

a. If the correlation coefficient between the times $X$ and $Z$ is $r=-0.69$, compute the regression line of $X$ on $Z$.

Solution
========

a. $\bar x=`r round(mx,4)`$ min, $s_x^2=`r round(s2x,4)`$ min$^2$,  
$\bar y=`r round(my,4)`$ min, $s_y^2=`r round(s2y,4)`$ min$^2$,  
$\bar z=`r round(mz,4)`$ min, $s_z^2=`r round(s2z,4)`$ min$^2$,  
$s_{xy}=`r round(sxy,4)`$ min$^2$ and $s_{yz}=`r round(syz,4)`$ min$^2$.  
Thus, there is a direct linear relation between $X$ and $Y$ and an inverse linear relation between $Y$ and $Z$.

a. $b_{xy}=`r round(bxy,4)`$ min.

a. $r^2_{xy}=`r round(r2xy,4)`$ and $r^2_{yz}=`r round(r2yz,4)`$, thus the regression line of $Y$ on $Z$ explains better $Y$ than the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ since $r^2_{yz}>r^2_{xy}$.

a. Regression line of $Y$ on $Z$: $y=`r round(ayz,4)` + `r round(byz,4)`z$ and $y(40)=`r round(ayz+byz*40, 4)`$.

a. $s_{xz}=`r round(sxz, 4)`$ and the regression line of $X$ on $Z$ is $x=`r round(axz,4)` + `r round(bxz,4)`z$.
