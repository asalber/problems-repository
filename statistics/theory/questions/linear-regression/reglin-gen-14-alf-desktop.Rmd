Question
========
In a regression study it is known that the regression line of $Y$ on $X$ is $y+2x-10=0$ and the regression line of $X$ on $Y$ is $y+3x-14=0$.
a. Compute the means of $X$ and $Y$.
a. Compute the linear correlation coefficient and interpret it. 

Solution
========
a. $\bar x=4$ and $\bar y=2$.
a. $r=-0.8165$. The linear correlation coefficient is near -1 so there is a strong inverse relation between $X$ and $Y$.
